# Lunarian Dream
_Lunarian Dream_ is a Minecraft Fabric mod (only supports 1.20.1 right now) adding the _Dream World_ dimension
from Touhou ([Touhou 15 LoLK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/937580/Touhou_Kanjuden__Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom/) in particular).
Currently, the mod is playable and offers unique content, but is still **underdeveloped**, at least as to what I envisioned.

## Features

- Teleport to the Dream World by either dying while sleeping, or finding a rare structure in the sky (mostly above oceans).
- Dream World is an obsidian grid, with a custom (but rather modest) sky shader thing.
- Find Doremy's house in the Dream World (near x,z = 0, but pretty high up).
- Talk and Trade with Doremy Sweet via [Blabber](https://modrinth.com/mod/blabber).
- Explore dungeons with dangerous enemies and appropriate loot, designed for vanilla endgame.
- Loot is just vanilla items, partially with impossible enchantments. Also 2 new unique enchantments.
- Get back home by dying (don't break your legs). 

## TODOs

The list is supposed to be in the order of descending severity/urgency (also considering how hard it would be to implement), but is subject to change.

1. **Ambient Music, obviously a Touhou remix.**
  - [LoLK Stage 3 theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KdnK6RYjnn4) could work.
  - Although the remix would need to be more chill to fit with Minecraft music.
2. **Better ways of teleporting to and from the Dream World.**
  - The current methods are functional but don't feel intuitive or immersive.
3. **Better Doremy dialogue and outcomes.**
4. **Unique items or blocks, as a potential reward in the dungeons.**
  - Currently, compared to a vanilla dungeon such as the ocean temple, the two unique enchantments
    probably provide enough exploration value in a vanilla context.
  - The illegally enchanted loot that can currently be found, whilst incentivizing exploring the dungeons,
    feels idk, not immersive?
5. **Better Dream World custom visuals.**
6. **Danmaku? Items that let the player shoot danmaku projectiles and maybe enemies/blocks shooting them at the player.**
  - I wouldn't call this necessary but it would be quite cool.
7. **More/Better structures (dungeons) in the Dream World.**
8. **Generally more Touhou stuff, since currently the only relation to Touhou is Doremy and the name of the dimension.**
9. **Unique enemies.**
10. **More music, e.g. dungeon music or Doremy music.**
11. **Maybe, big maybe: Bosses.**
  - Fight Doremy?
