# Lunarian Dream
_Lunarian Dream_ is a Minecraft Fabric mod adding the _Dream World_ dimension
from Touhou ([Touhou 15 LoLK](https://store.steampowered.com/app/937580/Touhou_Kanjuden__Legacy_of_Lunatic_Kingdom/) in particular).
Currently, the mod is playable and offers unique content, but is still **underdeveloped**, at least as to what I envisioned.

## Requirements

- [Blabber](https://modrinth.com/mod/blabber)
- [Fabric Language Kotlin](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-language-kotlin)
- [Fabric API](https://modrinth.com/mod/fabric-api)
- Minecraft 1.20.1 with Fabric Loader

## Features

- Teleport to the Dream World by either dying while sleeping, or finding a rare structure in the sky (mostly above oceans).
- Dream World is an obsidian grid, with a custom (but rather modest) sky shader thing.
- Find Doremy's house in the Dream World (near x,z = 0, but pretty high up).
- Talk and Trade with Doremy Sweet via Blabber.
- Explore dungeons with dangerous enemies and appropriate loot, designed for vanilla endgame.
- Loot is just vanilla items, partially with impossible enchantments. Also 2 new unique enchantments.
- Get back home by dying (don't break your legs).
